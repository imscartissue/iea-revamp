/**
 * The only module in the app that imports the data file.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices here:
 *
 * 1. `schools.json` is imported directly rather than fetched. There is no API,
 *    so a fetch layer would add a loading state, a skeleton, an error path and
 *    a request for 5.4 kB gzipped. The data is inlined into the JS chunk.
 *
 * 2. The indexes below are built at MODULE SCOPE, once for the lifetime of the
 *    app — not in a hook, not in a selector, not per render. `getSchool` is O(1)
 *    and never re-computes.
 *
 * Every score, rank and band lives in `schools.json` itself.
 * There is no scoring arithmetic in the browser
 * by design: the numbers are data, not logic, so a component cannot mis-apply a
 * weight and two pages cannot disagree.

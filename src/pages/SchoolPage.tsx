 * One school, everything we know about it.

 * the id, the inner one owns the effect. A bad `:id` is an ordinary state on
 * this route, not an error case, and an early `return` before `useEffect` is a
 * rules-of-hooks violation.
 *
 * The resolved `School` is passed down rather than re-looked-up, so the SEO
 * effect can depend on real fields instead of an `id` it would have to resolve
 * again — and so there is exactly one place that decides whether this URL is a
 * school or a 404.
